What image of a city emerges when combining social and economic data with mobility data? What stirring stories are contained in this data and how can they be conveyed with the help of digital tools? The interactive piece visualizes unique route profiles of the informal and formal mobility networks of Cape Town. The intention of the prototype is to motivate users to get information about the diverse living conditions of the city and to contribute their own perspectives on spatial and social mobility. Exemplarily, it is shown how annotation for specific routes opens up the space for personal stories along routes. The mobility data was provided by the startup [WhereIsMyTransport](https://www.whereismytransport.com/). The socio-economic data were obtained from qualitative surveys conducted by the [Federal Statistical Office of South Africa](http://www.statssa.gov.za/).",

          "description": "Urban mobility is constantly changing. Bikesharing has been used more and more in large cities for several years now, allowing bikes to be rented and parked flexibly throughout the city. How can the collected data help in urban planning and create insights into usage and frequency in the Berlin area? The interactive visualization, optimized for touch screen, enables the user to explore the potential of shared mobility services for each district of Berlin and to analyze the usage over time. The intent is to create interest and consciousness through an overview of rental bike offers in Berlin through a data-driven immersive interface. Micro scenarios provide additional information about the spatial conditions of Berlin. The project is part of the permanent exhibition of [CityLAB Berlin](https://citylab-berlin.org) from June 2019. It was also exhibited at the techDetector conference in Berlin in September 2019, organized by [GiZ](https://giz.de). A backend infrastructure was developed to process the bike-data on a daily basis by public APIs of the providers Lidl-Bike and Next-Bike. A set of scripts analyse and transform the bike rides and bring them into the correct formats.",

The data can be explored through four extensive storylines. A scroll-based storytelling module immerses into the complex course structures which unfold over time and provide additional context through pointed essays.

Comments are displayed chronologically for each article and nested comments are created in new interpretations of lists. The result is a typographic cyber punk reader that exchanges usability and conventionality for rawness and resistance against the common sense of usability and web standards.

What image of a city emerges when combining social and economic data with mobility data? What stirring stories are contained in this data and how can they be conveyed with the help of digital tools? The interactive piece visualizes unique route profiles of the informal and formal mobility networks of Cape Town. The intention of the prototype is to motivate users to get information about the diverse living conditions of the city and to contribute their own perspectives on spatial and social mobility. Exemplarily, it is shown how annotation for specific routes opens up the space for personal stories along routes. The mobility data was provided by the startup [WhereIsMyTransport](https://www.whereismytransport.com/). The socio-economic data were obtained from qualitative surveys conducted by the [Federal Statistical Office of South Africa](http://www.statssa.gov.za/).",

The interactive visualisation allows users to read out the wheel counting stations that have been put into operation and to discover temporal patterns of Berlin cyclists. The visualization shows daily, weekly and annual cycling patterns. Furthermore, the data can be displayed in three levels of detail (median, absolute, maximum). The data comes from 26 permanent counting stations embedded in the ground and comprises more than 8760 counts.",

Bikesharing has been used more and more in large cities for several years now, allowing bikes to be rented and parked flexibly throughout the city. How can the collected data help in urban planning and create insights into usage and frequency in the Berlin area? The interactive visualization, optimized for touch screen, enables the user to explore the potential of shared mobility services for each district of Berlin and to analyze the usage over time. The intent is to create interest and consciousness through an overview of rental bike offers in Berlin through a data-driven immersive interface. Micro scenarios provide additional information about the spatial conditions of Berlin. The project is part of the permanent exhibition of [CityLAB Berlin](https://citylab-berlin.org) from June 2019. It was also exhibited at the techDetector conference in Berlin in September 2019, organized by [GiZ](https://giz.de). A backend infrastructure was developed to process the bike-data on a daily basis by public APIs of the providers Lidl-Bike and Next-Bike. A set of scripts analyse and transform the bike rides and bring them into the correct formats.",
