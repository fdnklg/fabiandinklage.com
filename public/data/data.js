A working prototype provides an interface to explore all organized meetups of Berlin within the last 10 years. While attendees get lots of information around their interests the prototype aims to create insight around the social network data and compare temporal structures. How did the platform grow and which interests are most represented? How socially related are groups from one to another? This approach tries to find answers to these questions while providing a fluid and story driven experience.",
